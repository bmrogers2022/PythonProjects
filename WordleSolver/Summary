This is a program I made when I was first learning python in high school and my first successful big project. 
It is meant to solve the wordle by giving the user recommended words. 
It is slow and unoptimized, but it is functional and can find the wordle extremely quickly, having a median solve time of 3 guesses and an undefeated record
